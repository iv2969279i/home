  <p>HAYAKU is committed to delivering high-quality professional services to clients with speed and reliability.
To maintain the platform’s service standards, all approved service providers are expected to respond to client inquiries as quickly as possible and aim to complete projects ahead of schedule whenever feasible. This is considered a fundamental service principle, and we expect all providers to adhere to it.</p>
  <p>Providers who consistently respond promptly and deliver efficiently will receive a higher share of business investment and resource support, which in turn leads to greater opportunities for project engagement and successful transactions.</p>

  <p>The potential customers provided by the platform mainly come from the following channels:</p>
